### Working with M2MQTT

- M2MQTT for Unity adds a **M2MqttUnityClient** MonoBehaviour that wraps the M2QTT .NET client
- Created a new manager class **MqttBrokerConnectionManager** to expose more events than M2MqttUnityClient, and implement a Scriptable Object **MqttBrokerConnectionSettings** to hold broker settings. Using a Scriptable Object makes switching between brokers quick and easy
- **MqttBrokerConnectionSettings** also holds a list of Topics to subscribe to
    - R2mvDemo/cc1 - 8 (continuous change) handle knobs values from 0 to 1
    - R2mvDemo/t1 - 8 (toggle) handle pads / taps toggle as True or False
- **MqttBrokerVSNotificationRelay** connects to the connection manager and handles sending or receiving Visual Scripting Notifications
    - Holds 4 Notifications
        -  Message Decoded (Incoming MQTT message)
        - Publish (Send message to MQTT Broker)
        - Connection Succeeded
        - Connection Failed
- **Notifications** are custom Visual Scripting units 
    - handle or send messages through the Event Bus
    - Use a scriptable object to define notifications types
    - Can include arguments (variable / values)
