## Demo Walkthrough

All code is contained in the **SpatialAnchorsDemo** component. Using the Azure SDK **SpatialAnchorManager** to manage authentication and interface with Azure backend services.

### Spatial Anchors Demo
- Defined 4 app states
    - Start
    - Placing Anchor
    - Creating Spatial Anchor
    - Locating Anchor
- Created 4 UI views for the appâ€™s UX
- References
    - The prefab to use as visual anchor
    - SpatialAnchorManager
    - ARRaycastManager
- Public API -> handle user requests for
    - Restart
    - PlaceAnchor
    - SaveAnchor
    - LocateAnchor
    - ClearHistory
- Demo Lifecycle -> Manages the state of the application
    - Initialization
    - Update elements based on Demo State
    - Update UI
- Spatial Anchor Event Handlers -> Interface with the SpatialAnchorManager 
    - Mostly event handler (Delegates)
    - CloudManagerOnAnchorLocated -> Called when a cloud anchor is located! Use LocateAnchorStatus.Located to place an AR Anchor.
    - Show AddFoundCloudSpatialAnchor CloudNativeAnchor -> Azure SDK component 
CloudToNative(anchor) handles placing the anchor in the correct position and rotation!
- History and Anchor creation management
    - CreateSpatialAnchor
        - Complex method
        - Responsible creating the Azure Anchor using the local AR Foundation anchor
        - Handles communication with backend service for visually positioning anchors and saving the data on Azure
        - Waits for IsReadyForCreate
        - Uses CreateAnchorAsync
    - LoadSpatialAnchorHistory
    - SaveSpatialAnchorHistory
    - System uses the same data structure as the Google Cloud Anchor demo!
        - SpatialAnchorHistory
        - SpatialAnchorHistoryCollection
        - PlayerPrefs and JSON serialization / de-serialization
